<h2>General Rules</h2>
We will be playing 5 rounds of bingo.  The details of each round are outlined below.<br />
A round is over when the first person complets a win of at least one of their boards and yells, "BINGO" to notify the group.<br/>
In the event that more than one person yells "BINGO" (and actually has BINGO) at the same time, the prize for that round will be split evenly among the winners</br>
You should clear your board(s) and use them again in each round.<br />
 - Ex. If you have five boards, you should be playing with five boards in round-1, five boards in round-2, five boards in round-3, five boards in round-4 and five boards in round-5.<br />
We will check to make sure the person that yells BINGO actually has won, so please wait to clear your boards until after we can confirm the winner.<br />

<h2>Ali's Pro Tip</h2>
If you are playing with printed boards, you can put your board in a ziplock bag and use dry erase markers to mark your board and easily erase after each round.  Or you can cover your numbers with pennies. (Ali recommends dimes over pennies)<br />
